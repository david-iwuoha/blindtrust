# BlindTrust App - Accessibility Rules

## Audio Cues:

## Haptics:
- Provide a vibration when a transaction is successfully completed.
- Provide a different vibration for errors or warnings.

## Language Choices:
- Users can select their preferred language: English, Pidgin, Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa.

## Voice Speed Control:
- Users can say "slow down" or "speed up" to control how fast the app speaks.

## Read-back Convention:
